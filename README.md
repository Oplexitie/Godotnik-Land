A WIP 2D Sonic the Hedgehog framework made for Godot 4 based on [GoSonic2D](https://github.com/marmitoTH/GoSonic2D).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Like [Simple Sonic Worlds](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/simple-sonic-worlds.36075/) this framework is supposed to only contain the basic necessities to build your own Sonic like game.
>As such, I will not be adding :
>  - A - Specific level gimmicks from the original games
>  - B - Powerups that aren't necessary for a Sonic like game
>  - C - Features that make the project a convoluted mess
 
 ## Other info

If you encounter any bugs with an **unmodified version of the framework**, please post the issue on Github with a video attached.
